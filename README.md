# Prolog

This project focused on the development on prolog language. I created a prolog video game on the classical "Connect Four" game.

You play against an IA whith different difficulties.

To play, execute the file Puissance4_final.pl with a prolog interpreter like http://www.swi-prolog.org/.

The game possesses bascics graphics to ease the understanding of the game.
